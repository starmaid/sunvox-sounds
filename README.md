# sunvox-sounds
Collection of sunvox sounds I make.

I want to make a few powerful keyboards. I don't really like the ones on the website.


## Radiohead

## The Rhodes

I think the rhodes EP is the most classic, powerful electric piano sound out there. That should be the default sound on startup of this synthesizer.

Physically, a rhodes is a bunch of tuning forks on guitar pickups, and was built by fender for a bit.

## The Roland Juno-60

This is what Vulfpeck plays on the it gets funkier II track, as well as a few other places. I want to do some more work with this keyboard, maybe even expose the functionality to get more of their sounds.
